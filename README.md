# Basic Games in Pascal

This is, somewhat, of a mirror of Jeff Atwood's([@coding-horror](https://github.com/coding-horror)) [Basic Computer Games](https://github.com/coding-horror/basic-computer-games) but in Pascal/Object Pascal.

The why of this being a parallel repository is explained by this issue: [Should every language be included in the project?](https://github.com/coding-horror/basic-computer-games/issues/15)

I'll trod along for the whole 90 something examples and will welcome any help.

I'm keeping this repository as a nice excercise on porting legacy code.
